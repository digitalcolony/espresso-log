# Espresso Log 2024

I use a Google form to track each espresso I order. That form writes to a Google Sheet. When the Sheet is updated, a Zapier job triggers a Netlify site build. Netlify queries the Google Sheet to build the website. The website use the Astro framework.

## Project Duration

This project was active throughout 2024, documenting every espresso ordered during that calendar year.
